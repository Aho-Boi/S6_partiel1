# Inlining

There's no excuse for not using accessors, there is no performance loss.

**inline** considerably improves the opportunities for optimization, however
excessive inlining causes code bloat.

Inlining is not automatical for compilers, it is just a way of suggesting something
to the compiler.

# Callable entities

## Lambda

Lambas can be used as predicates for standard algorithms, example :

```
sort(v.begin(), v.end(), [](int a, int b) { return a > b;});
```

We can then call procedures without naming them directly in the codes.

Lambdas are more than Functions :

```
auto delta = 2;
auto incr = [delta](int x) { return x + delta;};
std::cout << incr(2) << std:endl;
// 4
```

We can set local variables, or use auto.

## Lambdas demystified

# Pointers

There are three iportant types:

* shared ownership
* no ownership at all
* unique ownership

We have:

* shared\_ptr shares ownership
* weak\_ptr is a non-owning pointer
* unique\_ptr is a transfer of ownership pointer

## Unique pointers

unique\_ptr has a nice constructor :

```
auto u = std::make_unique<int>(2);
```

Cannot copy a unique pointer but can move a unique pointer.

```
auto u = std::make_unique<int>(2);
auto u2 = std::move(u);
assert(u == nullptr);
```

We can :

```
auto p = std::make_shared<int>{};
p = std::make_unique<int>(12);
```

The temporary unique pointer gave (moved) its content before dying, however:

```
auto p = std::make_shared<int>{};
auto u = std::make_unique<int>(12);
p = u; // KO cause *not* unique
```

But :

```
auto p = std::make_shared<int>{};
auto u = std::make_unique<int>(12);
p = std::move(u); // transfer
assert(!u);
```

## Weak pointers

shared\_ptr are nice but:

* We just need some local temporary pointers
* or we can have circular references
* or we can also have asymmetrical relationships
* or we want to avoid dangling pointer problems

a weak\_ptr is great because it does not count.

Consider:

```
auto p = new int(10);
auto p2 = p;
delete p;
// p2 is around
```

versus

```
auto p = std::make_shared<int>(10);
auto p2 = std::weak_pttr<int>{p};
p.reset();

//p2 is around but:
assert(p2.expired == true);
```

We cannot have a weak pointer pointing at the memory address of a unique pointer.

# Within class space

# RTTI

dynamic\_cast => very powerful tool

```
shape s = shape{1, 1};

auto c = dynamic_cast<circle*>(s);

if (c)
  return true;
```

# Conclusion about C++

C++ is a very powerful tool but riddled with historical idioms
